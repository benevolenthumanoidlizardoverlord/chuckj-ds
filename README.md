**NOTE:** *As of August 24, 2020, this repository is under maintenance. I am cleaning and collecting past projects and packages from other sources. It will be back online in early September.*

This is a public repository containing my data science work, analyses, visualizations, and packages that might be useful to others. Some highlights include:
1. A reverse geocoder package that maps latitude and longitude to city, county (i.e. level 2 location data), state (i.e. level 1 location data), and country. It outperforms other reverse geocoding packages I could find by ~35x (in terms of runtime). I used it when analyzing a multibillion row dataset of transit data, so speed was imperitive.
2. A data visualization I worked on for a study of traffic flows and driving behavior changes in light of the COVID-19 epidemic.
3. A trading indication model I built for personal use. It ingests stock data (from Yahoo api) and web scrapes for earnings reports, events, etc., and analyzes the data, producing performance indicaters that can be used to inform trading. No autotrading at this point. I haven't had the time to look into that yet.
